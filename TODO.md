 - [ ] use async to run a program that emulates a terminal running a program alongside the GUI app
   - share a string that both write to that functions as the terminal's text display

 - [ ] create library functions/macros that supply functionalility of "print!", "stdin().read_line", etc
    - printing should be the entire frame at once, will make everything easier and nicer
    - don't really need equivalents on the ui side, those are pretty much just used once per update
