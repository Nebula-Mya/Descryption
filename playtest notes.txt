For mystery cards, dont show 0/0 stats for explanation (in card choice event)

in sacrifice for sigils event, allow to go back at any point, not just end confirmation

implement saving current campaign in case of crashes

be able to view deck when choosing path

fix grammar with trapper (1 teeth) (and with lose screen)

show explanation after prospector

clarify steel trap text (check if leshy is given a pelt??)

show card when drawing from resource too

maybe let survivors lower cost

check that cards aren't being added as same instance from library (need to make library stuff be lists of classes instead of instances - will be big change)

display win results after boss

be able to see how many teeth you have

why are all sigil changes impacted ALL???? i think randomly added cards are the same instance as in library

be able to check deck before choosing draw

dont let 0 costs be summoned on top of other cards...

on very hard (or maybe also hard), start with cards on front row, also increase amount needed to win????

make it so stones can replace sigils

get teeth from boss battles

prevent it from adding mystery sigil

dam builder should inheret sigils

probs make unkillable not work on sacc

maybe get rid of starting squirrel

increase ouro's stats on sacc
