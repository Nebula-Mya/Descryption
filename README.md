# What is Descryption?
Descryption is a fan-made demake of Daniel Mullin's "Inscryption" in the style of MS-DOS text-adventure games. Focusing on Leshy's inscryption, the goal was to make a version of Inscryption that would have been distributed on floppy disks.

# What should I do before playing?
### Terminal Size
Descryption is played entirely through the terminal, with the only input being numbered selections in menus. It is recommended that you create a shortcut for the executable and change the properties so it opens maximised. If you do not, you can always maximise the terminal after opening, the formatting will update to the new size after the next input. &nbsp;

### Font
This game was designed using Consolas 10pt, though other monospaced fonts will work, as long as they support all characters used. For the best experience, it is recommended that you change the terminal's font to Consolas. A .ttf file for the font is included in the Resources folder.
