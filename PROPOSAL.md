This file will contain your Final Project Proposal. Answer the prompts below to outline your project. If you are struggling to think of ideas, refer to the [Project Overview](https://cs.oberlin.edu/~cs150/final-project/part-1/) for suggestions.

### (1) What is the title of your project?
Descryption

### (2) In 3-5 sentences, summarize what you want to accomplish. Provide enough detail so that I can understand your main idea, but try to keep things concise.


### (3) Try "backwards-designing" from your main idea and draft your program overview. See previous labs and/or coding demos for examples.
1. Inputs: What will you request from the user?

2. Computation: How are you transforming the inputs into something else? What data types could be helpful for managing information in the program? What functions will you create/use to produce specific effects?

3. Outputs: What will you present to the user?


### (4) In a numbered list, briefly describe your intermediate goal(s) based on your program overview.
Note that you will reflect on how well you were able to meet your intermediate goal(s) in your Progress Report.


### (5) Are you strongly committed to this idea, or would you like suggestions for alternatives?
