# Playtest Notes

## Bugs:

- [ ] fix grammar with trapper (1 teeth) (and with lose screen)

- [ ] check that cards aren't being added as same instance from library (need to make library stuff be lists of classes instead of instances - will be big change)
 > #### Files to revise:
 > - [ ] card_library.py
 > - [ ] QoL.py
 > - [ ] bosses.py
 > - [ ] card.py
 > - [ ] deck.py
 > - [ ] duel.py
 > - [ ] field.py
 > - [ ] menu.py
 > - [ ] rogue.py
 > - [ ] sigils.py

- [ ] dont let 0 costs be summoned on top of other cards...

- [ ] get teeth from boss battles

- [ ] prevent it from adding mystery sigil

- [ ] dam builder should inheret sigils

- [ ] increase ouro's stats on sacc



## Improvements:

- [ ] For mystery cards, dont show 0/0 stats for explanation (in card choice event)

- [ ] in sacrifice for sigils event, allow to go back at any point, not just end confirmation

- [ ] implement saving current campaign in case of crashes

- [ ] be able to view deck when choosing path

- [ ] show explanation after prospector event

- [ ] clarify steel trap text (check if leshy is given a pelt??)

- [ ] show card when drawing from resource too

- [ ] maybe let survivors lower cost

- [ ] display win results after boss

- [ ] be able to see how many teeth you have

- [ ] be able to check deck before choosing draw

- [ ] on very hard (or maybe also hard), start with cards on front row, also increase amount needed to win????

- [ ] make it so stones can replace sigils

- [ ] probs make unkillable not work on sacc (wait for further testing after bug fixes)

- [ ] maybe get rid of starting squirrel (give another main deck card, will need update to fair draw implementation)
